the fulton county grand jury said friday an investigation of atlantas recent primary election produced no evidence that any irregularities took place 
the jury further said in termend presentments that the city executive committee which had overall charge of the election deserves the praise and thanks of the city of atlanta for the manner in which the election was conducted 
the septemberoctober term jury had been charged by fulton superior court judge durwood pye to investigate reports of possible irregularities in the hardfought primary which was won by mayornominate ivan allen jr 
 only a relative handful of such reports was received the jury said considering the widespread interest in the election the number of voters and the size of this city 
the jury said it did find that many of georgias registration and election laws are outmoded or inadequate and often ambiguous 
it recommended that fulton legislators act to have these laws studied and revised to the end of modernizing and improving them 
the grand jury commented on a number of other topics among them the atlanta and fulton county purchasing departments which it said are well operated and follow generally accepted practices which inure to the best interest of both governments 
merger proposed 
however the jury said it believes these two offices should be combined to achieve greater efficiency and reduce the cost of administration 
the city purchasing department the jury said is lacking in experienced clerical personnel as a result of city personnel policies 
it urged that the city take steps to remedy this problem 
implementation of georgias automobile title law was also recommended by the outgoing jury 
it urged that the next legislature provide enabling funds and reset the effective date so that an orderly implementation of the law may be effected 
the grand jury took a swipe at the state welfare departments handling of federal funds granted for child welfare services in foster homes 
 this is one of the major items in the fulton county general assistance program the jury said but the state welfare department has seen fit to distribute these funds through the welfare departments of all the counties in the state with the exception of fulton county which receives none of this money 
the jurors said they realize a proportionate distribution of these funds might disable this program in our less populous counties 
nevertheless we feel that in the future fulton county should receive some portion of these available funds the jurors said 
 failure to do this will continue to place a disproportionate burden on fulton taxpayers 
the jury also commented on the fulton ordinarys court which has been under fire for its practices in the appointment of appraisers guardians and administrators and the awarding of fees and compensation 
wards protected 
the jury said it found the court has incorporated into its operating procedures the recommendations of two previous grand juries the atlanta bar association and an interim citizens committee 
 these actions should serve to protect in fact and in effect the courts wards from undue costs and its appointed and elected servants from unmeritorious criticisms the jury said 
regarding atlantas new multimilliondollar airport the jury recommended that when the new management takes charge jan the airport be operated in a manner that will eliminate political influences 
the jury did not elaborate but it added that there should be periodic surveillance of the pricing practices of the concessionaires for the purpose of keeping the prices reasonable 
ask jail deputies 
on other matters the jury recommended that 
four additional deputies be employed at the fulton county jail and a doctor medical intern or extern be employed for night and weekend duty at the jail 
 
fulton legislators work with city officials to pass enabling legislation that will permit the establishment of a fair and equitable pension plan for city employes 
the jury praised the administration and operation of the atlanta police department the fulton tax commissioners office the bellwood and alpharetta prison farms grady hospital and the fulton health department

state party chairman james w dorsey added that enthusiasm was picking up for a state rally to be held sept in savannah at which newly elected texas sen john tower will be the featured speaker
